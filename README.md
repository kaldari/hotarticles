This code is for generating hot articles reports for WikiProjects. These reports show which articles have been edited the most within the past 1 to 7 days (depending on report configuration).

It requires https://github.com/legoktm/harej-bots/blob/master/botclasses.php to be installed in the parent directory, as well as a config.inc.php file (see example).

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:HotArticlesBot/Config.json for the on-wiki subscription configuration.
